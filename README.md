# AzerType
AzerType is a simple web application that enables you to practice typing. It displays either words or sentences and you are to recopy it correctly: the correctness of your typing influences your score and progressively, your score is displayed to you.
At the end of the list, your final score is displayed which you can share to anyone using a mail.
This is an initiation project to put into practice the basic notions I learnt when following a couse on Javascript for Web development on OpenClassrooms.
This project touches the following notions:
- Types of variables, lists and objects in Javascript
- The use of conditions, loops and functions

- DOM selector: enabling us to manipulate objects in an HTML page
- Manipulating events and forms in Javascript
- Managing errors and using Regular expressions in Javascript
- sending an email from an HTML page
